## 🧠 How It Works

Helping Hands simplifies how **Volunteers** and **NGOs** connect and collaborate.  

### 🏢 1. NGOs Register & Create Events
NGOs can easily create an account, set up their profiles, and post new community service events.  
Each event includes details such as:
- 📅 **Date and Time**
- 📍 **Location**
- 📝 **Description** and **Purpose**  

This helps NGOs attract the right volunteers for their mission.

---

### 🙋‍♀️ 2. Volunteers Explore & Join Events
Volunteers browse through upcoming events, view their details, and register for the ones that match their interests and availability.  
They can also:
- Track the events they've joined  
- Unregister anytime if their plans change  

Simple, flexible, and volunteer-friendly.

---

### 🤝 3. Community Collaboration
Once events are live:
- NGOs can **view the list of registered volunteers** for each event  
- Volunteers can **see all their upcoming events** in one place  

Together, they build stronger communities and make social good more organized, transparent, and accessible.
